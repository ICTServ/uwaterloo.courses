# The University of Waterloo Course Catalog
This was made by Tristan Simpson, do not steal lmao
<br>
This project is unfinished but I wanted to put it on github for any suggestions on what I should add or any improvements to my code

The license will be converted to an Official MIT Copyright License once an official Github Release of this repository has been created :)


# Challenge
My challenge for this project is to use solely native golang modules
other than fasthttp which is used to host the api and send http requests.
- This challenge does not include hosting services, database services, etc.
- God help my soul for webscraping..
